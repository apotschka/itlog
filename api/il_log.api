    <method name = "set output interval">
        Set the output interval in microseconds.
        <argument name = "msecs" type = "integer" />
    </method>

    <method name = "entry">
        Add or update an entry of the logger provided that the print level
        argument does not exceed the print level of the logger. If entries of
        the same header name have been used before, the method accumulates the
        data and returns false. If no entry exists yet, the method creates it
        and returns true. Possible modes for accumulation of data are

        * IL_LOG_USE_LAST: Entry supplied last
        * IL_LOG_USE_AVERAGE: Average of entries since last printing.
        * IL_LOG_USE_MIN: Minimum of entries since last printing.
        * IL_LOG_USE_MAX: Maximum of entries since last printing.
        * IL_LOG_USE_SUM: Sum of entries since last printing.

        An additional flag IL_LOG_UNIT_INTERVAL can be set using "|" for special printing of
        values between 0 and 1. In this case, the entry format should be shorter
        than the header format by three characters.

    <method name = "set print level">
        Set the print level of the logger. All columns exceeding the current
        print level will not get printed.

    </method>

    <method name = "output line">
        If the time specified by the output interval has passed since the last
        time this method has printed a line, the accumulated data will be
        formatted and printed. Every 10th line, a newline and a header will be
        printed. The accumulated data of all entries will be reset.  If not
        enough time has passed, nothing happens.
